    <h1>MEDIA QUERIES</h1>

    <p>
        Media queries allow you to apply CSS styles depending on a device's media type (such as print vs. screen) 
        or other features or characteristics such as screen resolution or orientation, aspect ratio, 
        browser viewport width or height, user preferences such as preferring reduced motion, data usage, or transparency.
    </p>

    <p>
        A media query is composed of an optional media type and any number of media feature expressions, 
        which may optionally be combined in various ways using logical operators. Media queries are case-insensitive.
