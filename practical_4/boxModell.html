    <h2>BOX MODEL</h2>

    <div class="box">
        <p>
            The box model defines how these elements work together to create the box that appears on the page.
            The box model also defines the height, width, margin, and padding properties of each box.
            The total size of a box is calculated by adding the padding and border to the width and height of the content area. 
            For example, if an element has a width of 200 pixels, a left and right padding of 15 pixels,
            and a left and right border of 10 pixels, then the total width of the box would be 260 pixels.
